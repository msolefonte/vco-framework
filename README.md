# VCO2 Framework

[Steam Workshop Mod Link](#)

Victory Conditions Overhaul framework mod for Total War: Warhammer III.

## Introduction

Framework for Total War: Warhammer III that adds the possibility to easily add custom victory conditions to the game.

Modding victory conditions is notably difficult and time consuming because it requires to create a `startpos.esf` file
each time. This is a problem for the developer, as it takes more than ten minutes to compile and it leaves no logs, but
also for the user, as compatibility with other mods is broken. This framework solves all these problems.

## Introduced features

* Victory Conditions are now loaded dynamically
    * The compilation times have been reduced to zero
    * Creating `startpos.esf` is no longer required
    * Compatibility patches are neither
    * Easier and faster debug
* Objectives are now loaded per faction, not in blocks
    * Small bugs are not longer going to affect large sets of factions
    * Easier debugging, as now only one faction is going to have bugs at a time
* Native support for add-ons and submods
    * Creating custom victory conditions is now encouraged
    * New submods for new victory conditions type are now available: Economic, Military and Cultural Victories are back
    * Now users can choose which victory conditions they want to have active
* Enhanced compatibility with faction unlockers and major campaign modifications
* Complete support for scripted objectives
    * Now the victory objectives are not limited to the default options

### As a developer

To create a submod you have to create a `.pack` file composed by two things: the framework loader and the victory
conditions. First of all, you have to decide a name for your mod. This name does not have the be the same that the
one you use in the `.pack` file or the Steam Workshop, but has to be consistent along the mod. In this guide, we are
going to call it `your-mod-name`.

#### The framework loader

Once decided, you have to create a script named `<your-mod-name>.lua` and place it in the `script/campaign/mod/` folder.
The content of that script has to be the following one:

```lua
local vco = require("script/vco/lib/vco")

cm:add_first_tick_callback(function() vco:trigger_custom_missions("<your-mod-name>") end);
```

#### The factions folders

Then, you have to create the folder `src/script/<your-mod-name>` and place there a folder for each faction you want to 
mod. Inside that folder, create one new folder for each campaign you want to cover. The name has to be the campaign key.
An example of this would be `main_warhammer` or `wh3_main_chaos`.

Now, next folder name has to be the key of the faction, which can be checked in the table `factions`, available at Dave. 
For example, the folder name for The Golden Order has to be `wh2_dlc13_emp_golden_order`. Finally, inside of it, you 
have to create a `missions.lua` file where all the victory conditions are going to be placed.

All in all, to add new victory conditions to The Golder Order Immortal Empires campaign, you have to create these files:

* `script/campaign/mod/<your-mod-name>.lua`
* `script/<your-mod-name>/main_warhammer/wh2_dlc13_emp_golden_order/missions.lua`

#### The objectives script

Now, inside of each `missions.lua`, you have to export a list of missions, which is an array of strings in the default
`victory_objectives.txt` format. Here goes one simple example:

```lua
local missions = {
    [[
 		mission
		{
			victory_type vco_victory_type_alternative_2_threat_elimination;
			key wh_main_long_victory;
			issuer CLAN_ELDERS;
			primary_objectives_and_payload
			{
				objective
				{
					type CONTROL_N_PROVINCES_INCLUDING;
					total 2;
					override_text mission_text_text_wh_main_objective_override_empire_sylvania;

					province wh_main_eastern_sylvania;
					province wh_main_western_sylvania;
				}

				objective
                {
                    type DESTROY_FACTION;

                    faction wh_main_vmp_vampire_counts;
                    faction wh_main_vmp_schwartzhafen;

                    confederation_valid;
                }

				payload
				{
					game_victory;
				}
			}
		}
    ]]
};

return missions;
```

As the missions interfaces are changing constantly, as I keep adding new options. You can find the list in this 
framework under the path `src/db/victory_types_tables/vco`. It is important to understand that only one type of each
can be available at the same time per faction, so, if you own multiple submods that add, for example, a Long Victory
condition, one is going to override the other.
