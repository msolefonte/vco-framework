IMPORTANT

This is a movie mod. It can easily break your game so ensure you follow this rules if you plan to use it.

- The mod will be named AAA_MOVIE_XYZ.pack. Do not change that name, as it is done in order to be easily spotted on the
top of the folder/manager for later removal. It is your own responsibility to keep track of your own movie mods.
- You install these mods by putting them in data/, and you uninstall by deleting the crap out of them. Again, these
packs CANNOT be disabled otherwise. DO IT ONCE THE WORKSHOP IS OUT AND USE THE WORKSHOP THEN.
- Those mods are likely to be inefficient and incompatible given the early circumstances. It's your responsibility to
get rid of those at the first sign of trouble and upon the upcoming patches.
- I still do not encourage sharing movie packs at this point, as they can include bugs or breaking stuff that will not
be automatically fixed, as they have to be updated manually. Be aware of what you use and do not get into huge and
complex overhauls. It can wait for the workshop.
- DESTROY THIS PACK ONCE THE WORKSHOP IS OUT
